#### Step 1:
- Open your minecraft profile
- go to config/axiom/hotbars
- **if** your want to restore a already set up Hotbar figure out which save that would be e.g creation time
- if you dont want to restore a hotbar delete all saves

#### Step 2:
- join the server
- set up the hotbar system as you wish
- leave the server (do not join again as this would generate a second hotbar save)

#### Step 3:
- run the script
- select both target file and target folder (should be the same but if you have a save in the 1.21.1 profile you can copy that over too)
- Press the Generate 256 files button
- You know should have the same hotbar each time you join

#### Step 4:
- to update changes made to the current hotbar
- press the replace with most recent button **each** time u leave the server
